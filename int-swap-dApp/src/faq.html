          <h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <div class="center" style="width: 650px">
            <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">1.  Who would want to do this?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
            Homeowners with variable rate mortgages who do not plan to own their homes long enough to justify paying refinancing costs but would like to lock in their interest cost for the rest of the time they expect to own it.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
            Homeowners with fixed rate mortgages who think interest rates will decline in the future and want to reduce their interest expense without having to pay refinancing costs.
            </p>
             <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
            Homeowners who want to refinance but find that they are no longer eligible due to reduced income, decline in percentage of condo units that are owner-occupied, tightened bank underwriting rules, etc.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">2.  How is the swap contract rate determined?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
              The swap contract rate is the "forward" rate for the one-month US Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  LIBOR is an index rate found in many variable rate mortgages across the US.  The "forward" rate is the effective rate expected for a future period based on current market conditions.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">3.  Why would anyone be a counterparty?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
              Corporations and other entities can manage their interest expense through interest rate swaps.  Banks can manage the interest sensitivity of their balance sheets for stress tests through interest rate swaps. Borrowers in other parts of the world can be in a different phase of the interest rate cycle from the US.
            </p>
             <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
             IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> can provide a considerable savings over the cost of institutional interest rate swaps for corporations that must pay a markup over the wholesale rate.  All IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> contracts are executed at the pure wholesale risk-free rate with a small fully-disclosed service charge instead of an undisclosed markup.  The savings must be weighed against the interest income not earned on the escrow.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">4.  How is the escrow amount determined?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
            The escrow amount will vary with the length of the contract and is generally established at a level that 90% of the time will cover all the profit or loss from interest rate fluctuations over the past thirty years.  An escrow of 0.20% (0.002) of the notional value is used for this demo based on a typical maturity of two years.

            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">5.  Does it matter what my current annual rate is?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
              No. Your current annual rate is used only to display how your total interest cost will be affected by an IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> contract.  As your current variable rate interest increases, it is offset by the profit on IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> (for a variable to fixed swap contract.)

            </p>
             <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">6.  Do I have to have a mortgage to do this?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
                No, you don't have to have a mortgage.  You can use IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> to manage the interest rate risk on your credit card or other debt that increases with the prime rate or even just to speculate on the future level of interest rates.
            </p>
             <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">7.  Am I assured a net profit on a fixed to variable swap if interest rates go down?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
                No.  Interest rates may decline less than the swap contract rate; even professional economists disagree on the timing and extent of changes in the level of interest rates.
            </p>

             <h4 style="color: #096EB6;">8.  What is the technical financial term for this?</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify" class="bullets">
                IntSwaps<sup>TM</sup> is a deferred interest rate swap with an embedded option.
